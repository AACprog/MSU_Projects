# About repository
There's nothing to say. This is just my code for projects
# How to build
For Task1:
You need to open terminal in Task1 directory, then write make and for running your task type build/* n r s filename, just like in manual for first task.
For Task2: 
Repeat all for Task1, but you need to add p for running, - build/* n p r s filename.
For Task3: 
Open terminal in Task3 directory, then type make and for running type build/* n m eps k filename
# How to find source code 
In Task* you can find Makefile and in Task*/code you can find all files
# How to find compiled program 
It located in Task*/build
# Some additional info
In manual I used regex from bash(Task* for example)
Also you can check SomeBullshit directory, where you can find hashmaps on clean c or something else. It's my experimental programs. You can use it in your projects, if you want. 
# Important info
I don't use windows, and I don't adapt programs for this os. All my programs are made for Linux and can work on macos. Btw I use Fedora 41))))))))
